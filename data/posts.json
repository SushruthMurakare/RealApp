I started going to the gym just down the road and I'm already feeling the difference. I was worried about feeling judged but over this last week I've seen how supportive the environment can be. Get out there and be your best self!",

They say the best time to buy real estate is twenty years ago and while we couldnt do that at the time, my husband Joey and I have been putting more into our saving for the last two years to afford this upgrade. We couldn't have done it without our wonderful agent Lisa who helped us find this place, and connect us to a Broker for our mortgage. Its a big upgrade, and we thought it was the right time. I can't wait for our little girl to grow up here! #HomeSweetHome",

Finding the time after work and on weekends to submit applications and brush up on my skills for coding interviews was challenging but allowed me to now find my dream job where I hope to stay. I faced plenty of rejections—but I kept going. The things that helped me the most were: Practicing coding problems (using websites like LeetCode), improving my projects to showcase on GitHub, and reaching out to my connections for guidance. If you’re on the same path, I can assure you that the extra work in the short term is well worth finding a job you love. Focus on making connections and remember: every rejection is just a step closer to your success!",
